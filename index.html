      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p id="intro">
        Francesca (Fran) Kirby, Chelsea's prolific number 14, has cemented herself as one of
        Chelsea Women's most iconic and lethal players at the club. This tribute to Fran showcases
        her talent and strength; some of the many reasons as to why she is revered as one of
        the greats in Women's football. Instead of choosing to shed light on one of Chelsea's male footballers, I chose
        Fran as the subject of this tribute instead, hoping to challenge my own instincts when it comes to
        showing appreciation of the incredible amount of talent seen at the club I support.

      <h2>Appreciation</h2>
      <p>
        One of the reasons I chose Fran in particular was not only because of her footballing ability, but due to her triumphant battle with
        the rare condition <em>pericarditis.</em> The condition is known to cause inflammation of the pericardium -- a fluid
        filled sac that covers the heart, which in turn meant, she was to be told by medics that she would not be able to play
        football again. Despite the a grave outlook to her football career, Fran had not only fought the odds to make a full recovery
        and comeback to football, but playing at a level that saw her recognised as the top performer at the club,
        becoming Chelsea's all-time goalscorer and playing a crucial part in the many trophies that followed.
