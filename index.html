      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p id="intro">
        Fran Kirby, Chelsea's prolific number 14, has cemented herself as one of
        Chelsea Women's most iconic and lethal players at the club. This tribute to Fran showcases
        her talent and strength; some of the many reasons as to why she is revered as one of
        the greats in Women's football. She is a hugely decorated player, winning multiple
        Women's Super League titles and Women's FA Cup titles. Considered to be an "all-round forward" player, 
        she manages to time and time again prove to be such a threat in the team, scoring a range of
        decisive and magical goals. Not only is Fran a talented player for club but for country as well, 
        being an key player in England's finals in both the Europeans Championships and World Cups.

      <h2>Appreciation</h2>
      <p>
        One of the reasons why Fran is so respected in the game is because of her triumphant battle with
        the rare condition <em>pericarditis.</em> The condition is known to cause inflammation of the pericardium -- a fluid
        filled sac that covers the heart, which in turn meant, she was to be told by medics that she would not be able to play
        football again. Despite the a grave outlook to her football career, Fran had not only fought the odds to make a full recovery
        and comeback to football, but playing at a level that saw her recognised as the top performer at the club,
        becoming Chelsea's all-time goalscorer and playing a crucial part in the many trophies that followed.
